## Product story

During these different times, people have learned to adapt to these situations. Exercising and working out is one of them, we are limited just to our doorsteps and cannot find out a way to workout like most of us would normally. A home gym is too much of an investment, so many companies came up with digital weights and home workout stations that is essentially like a 11 in 1 device. Despite it all sounding intriguing and stuff, it is still a few thousand dollars and as we know of the situation in the US, many people have ran out of savings and are struggling to survive, how can they simply pull out 4 thousand bucks and buy a home gym mirror. Although in these times, many would eliminate the unnessecary and focus on the essentials for their living, I believe that a healthy lifestyle is crucial to a physically and mentally positive lifestyle. Many people who are still in quarantine and want to get their daily workout routine in has came to the idea of body weight workouts, push ups, sit ups and many more.  That leads me to the point of why I came up with the Fitny, a wearable device in the form of compression shorts or compression tee shirt that enforces resistance on your body  so when you are doing you daily body weight excersises you can feel like you are packing on some pounds just like how to lets say, squat in a gym. A lot of body builders use a large amount of extra weights when they are doing the body excersises they do at home, doing it with out weights often significantly decrease the effects of the excersise as they would feel like doing it is effortless. The fitly does not only provide resistance for body joints when exercising, it can also be used to assist athletes or people who are recovering from a leg or arm injury as the the joint device can be controlled to no resistance at all. Overall, the Fitny is a device for people who are looking for a portable and useful workout experience just at the comfort of their home and also people that are looking for a recovery device for their joints.
